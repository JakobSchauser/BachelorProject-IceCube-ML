# BachelorProject-IceCube-ML

Using Graph Neural Networks for classifation and regression of data and Monte Carlo from IceCube Neutrino Observatory.

Some work was done in Google Colab, and should available here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_i6QWAH1k4WFS1wVSyUc6aj4uLqIdjwm?usp=sharing

Another large part was made on a virtual machine, the files from there will be added once I figure out how to.

Main technologies are:

  Architecture: Tensorflow / Keras / Spektral
  
  IDE: Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook / VSCode
  
  Database querying: sqlite3
